                We lose approximately 10 Million Hectares A Year (one hectare contains about 2.47 acres.)<br>We Are Losing Forests at a Rate Equivalent to 27 Soccer Fields per Minute<br>27% of our coral reefs have been destroyed. If the rate continues, remaining 60% will be gone in 30 years.<br>Globally, about 25 percent of the total land area has been degraded. When land is degraded, soil carbon and nitrous oxide is released into the atmosphere, making land degradation one of the most important contributors to climate change. Scientists recently warned that 24 billion tons of fertile soil was being lost per year, largely due to unsustainable agriculture practices. If this trend continues, 95 percent of the Earth’s land areas could become degraded by 2050.<br>Air pollution kills over seven million people each year.(91%0 of people breathe bad air that is not within the WHO guidelines) <br>Experts predict that the rainforests will be entirely excavated by 2100.<br>The Great Pacific Garbage Patch. This garbage patch is the largest in the world when all factors are considered. It contains 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic, is estimated to weigh around 80,000 tons, and cover a surface of approximately 617,763 square miles. The patch is also constantly growing as up to 2.41 million tons of plastic and garbage enter the ocean each year.
