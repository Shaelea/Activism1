    <h1>Activism</h1>
    <h2 class ="intro">"We live in a world in which we need to share responsibility. It's easy to say 'It's not my child, not my community, not my world, not my problem.' Then there are those who see the need and respond. I consider those people my heroes." - Fred Rogers </h2>

    <h2>Ending Cruelty to Animals</h2>
    <p>The Goal: <b>Justice for every animal.</b> <br>
    There are pros and cons to giving animals rights. I believe that all animals have the capability to be sentient creatures. Therefore, to enslave/mistreat animals and keep them in slaughter houses is inhumane. I do understand the high demand for meat. This creates business opportunities which is helps with our economics. However, I'd like to argue that it is possible to keep up with the demands with a more humane way to hold animals. <br>
Slaughter houses are not our only problem. Animal hoarding, neglect, fighting (animal vs animal), violence(animal vs human), testing, ect. are a problem.<br>
What we can do? Here's a few: be a responsible pet owner, report abuse, being kind to animals, try a plant based diet, only buy the amount of meat you will eat, ect.

    <h2>Are World is our Responsability</h2>        
    <p>The Goal: <b>Protect and aid environment from various forms of destruction.</b> <br> 
    Climate change, pollution (water, air, radioactive, thermal, noise, ect.), waste disposal, population growth, deforestation, overfishing, nuclear waste, degradation(water, land/soil, atmospheric, ect.), ecosystem destruction, ect. <br>
    Many different ways to be involved as an environmentalist. Reduce, reuse, and recyle. Cut back on driving, throw away your garbage, plant a tree, create a compost pile, ect.

    <h2>Be Here for Each Other </h2>
    <p>The Goal:<b> Defends all humans.</b><br>
     Everyone deserves access to work and education, freedom of expression/opinion, freedom from torture and slavery, and the right to life and liberty. Some of our biggest issues, of the future, is human trafficking, workers rights, gender equality, spread of misinformation, refugee crises, ect. <br>
    How you can help? Speak up for what you care about. Listen to the needs of yur community, stay connected with social movements, stand up against discrimination, create positive change, ect.
